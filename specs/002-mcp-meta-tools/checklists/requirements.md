# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Meta-Tools for Progressive Discovery

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec references Spec 1 entities (ToolIndex, ToolIndexEntry, CLISummary) appropriately as dependencies.
- Success criteria SC-004 references "identical output" which is verifiable by comparing formatted responses.
- The spec deliberately does not prescribe the JSON structure of `climax_search` responses — that is an implementation decision. The spec requires the response to contain specific fields (FR-002, FR-004).
